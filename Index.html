        <h1>Rock paper scissors</h1>
       <p>Rock paper scissors is the first "real" project that i have worked on. The way i build it isn't optimized, but it does work. It was also the first project that i made usable with a phone. If i were to recreate it now i would make it in a diffrent way.</p>

       <h1>Strict password generator</h1>
            <p>This project was inspired by a page on reddit. I made this just for fun and doens't do anything special. It is made to annoy the user who is trying to make an account. The program annoys the user by changing the rules the user has to apply to.</p>

        <h1>Mastermind</h1>
          <p>This project was made directly after making the game 'Lingo' but this one took more time. It is made entirely in Javascript. It was quite tricky, but it works. It uses quite a lot of loops and id's. It doesn't work properly on a mobile device.</p>
